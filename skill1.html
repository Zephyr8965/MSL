<u>Graphing an Absolute value Function</u></br>
The following is an absolute value function. It is what we call the "Base Function" because there is nothing except Y, x, and an absolute value. We will first look at how to graph this function, then we'll use that to build a better method of graphing called "Transformations"</br></br>

`Y = abs(x)`</br>

Before we begin Transformations, we should first learn to build a graph of the base function. Below is such a graph. We'll talk about how to make that graph next. If you remember graphing lines last year, this should be a quick and easy review.</br>

<div align="center">
<embed width="150" height="150" src="d.svg" 
script='initPicture(-2,2)
axes()
stroke = "blue"
p = []
for (x = -2; x < 2; x += 0.1)
p[p.length] = [x, abs(x)]
path(p)'></div></br></br>

If you remember back to 9th grade when you first began learning to graph a linear function (a line), you needed to build an xy-table. Let's do that for our function. To do this, we'll pick numbers for x, then take the absolute value of them for Y. A good strategy is to take 0 and a couple numbers in the negative and positive directions. Note that I've put those numbers in order from smallest to largest.</br></br>

<div align="center">
`[[x,|,y=abs(x)],[-2,|,2],[-1,|,1],[0,|,0],[1,|,1],[2,|,2]]`
</div></br></br>

Next, we need to plot these points on a graph:</br>

<div align="center">
<embed width="150" height="150" src="d.svg" 
script='initPicture(-2,2)
axes()
stroke = "blue"
p = []
marker = "dot"
stroke = "clear"
for (x = -2; x <= 2; x += 1)
	p[p.length] = [x, abs(x)]
path(p)'>
</div></br></br>

After that, all that's left to do is connect the dots with a line. Take note of the shape you've created. Now that we know this shape, we can move on to transformations.
