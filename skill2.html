<u>Key Features of Absolute Value Graphs</u><br>
As with any type of function, it's important to take not of key features. This will make graphing transformations much easier in the future. Key features include the following (these would be good to put in your notes):<br><br>

<i>Intercepts</i><br>
Intercepts are often useful points due to either the x or Y being 0. Think about how much easier most math gets when things go to zero. Multiplication, addition, and more all get easier when you throw a zero in there. This is why intercepts are often some of the easiest points to work with.

The below diagram shows an absolute value function with the x-intercepts circled in green and the y-intercept circled in red.<br><br>

<div align="center">
<embed width="250" height="250" src="d.svg" 
script='initPicture(-4,4)
axes()
stroke = "blue"
p = []
for (x = -5; x < 5; x += 0.1)
p[p.length] = [x, abs(x)-2]
path(p)
stroke = "green"
circle([2,0],.5)
circle([-2,0],.5)
stroke = "red"
circle([0,-2],.5)'></br></br>
</div>

	Remember, the x-axis is the horizontal one and the y-axis is the vertical. So, when we say x-intercept, we mean the point where the function "intercepts" the x-axis, similarly to y-intercepts and the y-axis. Also remember that, when we hit the x-axis, the y-value is 0. Similarly, when we hit the y-axis, the x-value is 0. The video for this skill may help give you a better visual of this information.

<i>Vertex</i><br>
The vertex of any shape is generally some point where two sides of a shape come together. For an absolute value, this is the central point at the top or bottom of the "V". Below is an absolute value function with the vertex circled in yellow.<br><br>

<div align="center">
<embed width="250" height="250" src="d.svg" 
script='initPicture(-2.65,2.65)
axes()
stroke = "blue"
p = []
for (x = -5; x < 5; x += 0.1)
p[p.length] = [x, abs(x-1)+1]
path(p)
stroke = "gold"
circle([1,1],.5)'></br></br>

Finding these key features can significantly help with transformations. While these lessons will still use the original table of points, you can instead use these key features. The reason for this is that some people struggle to use the key features as anchors instead of those points, so this lesson will use those to ensure that more students are able to follow along.
