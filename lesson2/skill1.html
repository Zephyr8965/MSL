<u>Graph Absolute Value With 2 or More Transformations</u>
<br><br>

When we add more transformations to a function, we just have to work throug them one by one. When we mix vertical and horizontal transformations, it's no different. With vertical and horizontal, it doesn't matter which one we do first. Take the following function, for example:

`Y = 2abs(x-3) + 1`
