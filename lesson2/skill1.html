<u>Graph Absolute Value With 2 or More Transformations</u>
<br><br>

When we add more transformations to a function, we just have to work throug them one by one. When we mix vertical and horizontal transformations, it's no different. With vertical and horizontal, it doesn't matter which one we do first. Take the following function, for example:

`Y = 2abs(x-3) + 1`
<br><br>

Outside of the absolute value, we have multiplication by 2 and addition by 1. Inside, we have subtraction by 3. I generally like to do the inside first, so we'll start with that (but you can do the outside first if you prefer).
<br><br>
The subtraction by 3, being on the inside, will affect the x-values and have the inverse impact. This means our graph shifts 3 units to the right.
